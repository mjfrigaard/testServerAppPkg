# `tsap`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `tsap` is to demonstrate how to test a shiny application package using [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) and [`shiny::testServer()`](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/shiny/html/testServer.html)

## Installation

You don't want to install this package, but you might want to download it as an example (or read through [this post](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/posts/test-shiny-p2/) to learn about it's contents).

# Shiny server tests 

Check the shiny `testServer()` tests for `mod_var_select_server()` and `mod_scatter_plot_server()` in

```{r}
#| echo: false
fs::dir_tree("tests/")
```
